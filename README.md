## Introduction

Cool Comrade is an open-source CRM (Customer Relations Management) program. Though it's currently in its infancy, with your help, we can develop a straightforward, no-frills database that allows you to create databases, tables, queries, and more.

## Motivation

The problem lies in the fact that great CRMs are not cheap, good ones are not free, and free ones are overly complicated. Cool Comrade aims to fill this gap and provide a simple, open-source, free CRM tool that allows you to manage contacts, interactions, and other pieces of essential information.

## Contribution

Please join me in improving this project. Currently, most elements are hard-coded, which could potentially prove to be problematic for anyone not familiar with the languages used. Your expertise and contributions can help make this project more user-friendly and robust.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have PostgreSQL and Python3 installed on your local machine with the environment variables and paths configured correctly.
2. Clone this repository to wherever you want it on your local machine.
3. Open a text editor of your choice and edit any variables that you need to be edited.
4. Run the python script to input data to the database and table of your choice (assuming you are able to connect to the database and have privileges to do these things).

## Note

Please remember that this project is a one-person operation, and I'm self-teaching my way through this. Your patience, understanding, and contributions are much appreciated!
